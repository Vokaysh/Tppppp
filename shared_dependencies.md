1. "main.py": This file will contain the main function that will be used to run the application. It will import functions from "utils.py" and use constants from "constants.py". It will also use the configuration from "config.py".

2. "utils.py": This file will contain utility functions that will be used across the application. These functions will be imported by "main.py" and "tests/test_main.py", "tests/test_utils.py".

3. "constants.py": This file will contain all the constant values that will be used across the application. These constants will be imported by "main.py", "utils.py", "config.py", "tests/test_main.py", "tests/test_utils.py".

4. "config.py": This file will contain the configuration settings for the application. These settings will be used by "main.py".

5. "tests/test_main.py": This file will contain the test cases for "main.py". It will import the main function from "main.py" and utility functions from "utils.py".

6. "tests/test_utils.py": This file will contain the test cases for "utils.py". It will import the utility functions from "utils.py".

Shared Dependencies:

- Function Names: main, utility functions
