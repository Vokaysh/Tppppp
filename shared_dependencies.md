Shared Dependencies:

1. FastAPI: This is the main framework used in all the files for creating the API endpoints and handling requests.

2. Firebase Firestore: This is the database used in the application. It is used in the "app/database/firebase.py" file and the router files for storing and retrieving data.

3. User and Chat Models: These are the data schemas used in the application. They are defined in "app/models/user.py" and "app/models/chat.py" and used in the router files for validating request data.

4. User and Chat Routers: These are the route handlers for the application. They are defined in "app/routers/user.py" and "app/routers/chat.py" and used in "main.py" to include the routes in the application.

5. OpenAI API: This is used in "app/chatbot/openai.py" for generating chatbot responses. The API key for this is a shared dependency that should be stored in the ".env" file.

6. Error Handling Functions: These are used in all the router files for handling exceptions. They are defined in "app/utils/error_handling.py".

7. Logging Functions: These are used in all the files for logging runtime information. They are defined in "app/utils/logging.py".

8. Environment Variables: These are used in all the files for configuring the application. They are stored in the ".env" file.

9. User ID and Message Details: These are used in the router files for handling user progress updates, fetching user progress, sending chat messages, fetching chat messages, and generating chatbot responses. The user ID is a path parameter in the user routes, and the message details are part of the request body in the chat routes.

10. HTTP Status Codes: These are used in all the router files for indicating the result of a request. The specific codes used are a shared dependency that could be standardized across the application.
